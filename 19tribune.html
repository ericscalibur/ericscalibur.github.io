          UPI~Ships, locomotives and airlines that carry no fuel. An automobile uses only a small supply of hydrochloric acid as a power medium -- over and over again. A power plant generates electricity without consuming coal, petroleum or uranium.
        </p>
        <p>Fantasy or real possibilities?</p>
        <p>A Miami engineering firm has several small internal combustion engines already being run in this manner on ultraviolet light without requiring any real fuel.</p>
        <p>A California engineer says he is preparing to use an ultraviolet laser to extract hydrogen from water continually to power an automobile.</p>
        <p>No firm answer can yet be given to the question of whether either process is the key to solving the world’s energy problems. But the leading article in the may Scientific American by Prof. Avigdor N. Ronn of Brooklyn College, entitled “Laser Chemistry”, makes it clear that chemists around the world are working busily trying to use the energy of light as opposed to heat, the source of all energy up to now.</p>
        <p>If it turns out as chemists are starting to believe, that light can trigger controlled chemical reactions to produce enormously more energy than any thermal reaction from fossil fuel, then man indeed could be on the threshold of a truly unlimited source of energy. We could stop coal or petroleum for fuel and reserve it all for chemical feedstocks, particularly for fertilizer chemicals to produce food.</p>
        <p>The bitter issue over nuclear power would subside for nuclear power simply no longer would be needed. Uranium, henceforth, would be useful only for making weapons.</p>
        <p>The supply of light in nature is unlimited, and artificial light in the small amounts needed to set off chemical reactions to produce large amounts of energy can be obtained easily and cheaply from an ordinary automobile generator and storage battery.</p>
        <p>The Miami firm that is running small engines on ultraviolet light is Solar Reactor Corp., headed by Robin Parker. It is working on a reaction discovered partly by accident by Robert Scragg, an inventor. Scragg learned that ultraviolet light can set off a reaction between hydrogen and chlorine producing many times as much mechanical energy in a small engine as gasoline or diesel fuel.</p>
        <p>Further, the reaction can be produced in a closed loop with the small amount of hydrochloric acid used over and over agin like the vapor medium in a Rankine cycle steam engine.</p>
        <p>The actual energy used in the reaction comes from small ultraviolet light plugs made for Solar Reactor by Champion Spark Plug Co.</p>
        <p>It looks like the nearest thing to perpetual motion yet achieved although it isn’t really that. Parker and Scragg have not yet built the closed loop but they say it can be built out of off-the-shelf hardware available from several chemical equipment manufacturers.</p>
        <p>So far they have operated a Honda 4-cycle motorcycle engine, two small Tecumseh appliance engines, and a tiny turbine engine they built themselves by the method.</p>
        <p>Scragg made his discovery after realizing that all solar energy research up to now has been concerned with thermal energy, or the infrared end of the electromagnetic spectrum, whereas light contains more energy. It is light, not heat, that makes plants grow. Light has the energy to move itself at a speed of 186,000 miles a second. This led him to think about the laser, a device for utilizing light energy invented some 20 years ago. But the laser is a very expensive device and has never lived up to original expectations. [This was written in 1979]</p>
        <p>Then one day he ran across a report published in the 1920s by a graduate student saying that, in the presence of ordinary ultraviolet light, hydrogen and chlorine react with extreme violence to produce vast amounts of energy. Scragg was staggered.</p>
        <p>Scragg experimented successfully, then sought backers. Hydrochloric acid is easily made from seawater, is easily broken down into hydrogen and chlorine, and easily put back together. It takes as much energy to extract it from water as the energy it contains, but what difference does that make if you can use it over and over again more or less indefinitely?</p>
        <p>Brooklyn College’s Dr. Ronn said he knows Scragg and has discussed his discovery with him. Ronn said it may have all the potential Scragg believes, but it will take a lot of time and money to prove it.</p>
        <p>The closed loop is essential to prolonged operation of the light engine, not only to avoid consuming the hydrogen and chlorine but to prevent an exhaust. An exhaust from such an engine would be quite toxic and corrosive.</p>
        <p>Scragg and Parker estimate that an automobile powered by a light engine would carry one to three gallons of hydrochloric acid in its closed loop system. The acid would pass through a converter to be broken down into hydrogen and chlorine and the separate gases then would be fed into the engine’s cylinders and would react together as the ultraviolet plugs emitted light, creating an expansion to drive the pistons. Acceleration and deceleration would be controlled by a rheostat varying the timing of the light plugs, not by varying the flow of the gases.</p>
        <p>Even though the reaction is induced by light instead of heat, the temperature in the center of the cylinder reaches 1,000 degrees Fahrenheit. The thermal energy thus created without combustion is at least four times that of a gasoline engine and the mechanical energy appears to be up to 14 times as high as a gasoline engine of the same size.</p>
        <p>At 1,000 F., gaseous Hydrogen Chloride is not corrosive to metals, but as the gas leaves the cylinder it goes through a scrubber to return it to liquid hydrochloric acid to renew the cycle.</p>
        <p>Scragg and Parker concede that they do not fully understand what happens inside one of their engines when they are running, and that the action appears to violate some of the accepted laws of thermodynamics. That is one reason so much work must be done.</p>

      <h3 style="width: 80%; margin: auto; margin-top: 100px; margin-bottom: 100px;">Dave Parker began studying imperfections and
        making improvements to Scragg's work until he perfected the process,
        making it safe and non toxic. He now holds the current Patent Pending on
        these improvements which make the tech finally useable some 40 years later!
