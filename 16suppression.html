      <h3 style="width: 80%; margin: 100px">The photochemical reaction of
        Hydrogen and Chlorine is a non-radioactive power source, second in power only to nuclear.
        The power source  was suppressed at the beginning of the 19th century
        when Rockefeller and Standard Oil took financial control of chemistry
        through the Petro-Chemical monopoly of both Big Oil and Big Pharma.

      <h2 style="width: 80%; margin: 100px">In 1934, Nernst invented the word "Quantum" for the reaction because it
        was documented to be "One In and up to a Million Out!"

      <h3 style="width: 83%; margin: 100px; margin-bottom: 0px">In 1918, Walther Nernst proposed that the photochemical reaction between
      hydrogen and chlorine is a chain reaction in order to explain what's known
      as the quantum yield phenomena. This means that one photon of light is
      responsible for the formation of as many as 1 million molecules of the product
      HCl. Nernst suggested that the photon dissociates a Cl2 molecule into two
      Cl atoms which each initiate a long chain of reaction steps forming HCl.

        It was suppressed again, however, by the Manhattan Project during the
        development of the nuclear bomb as George Kistiakowsky was in charge of
        examining all explosions at the time. Later Kistiakowsky, traveled to
        Florida and met with Robert Scragg and told him that the Acedemic
        suppression of the Photochemical Reaction between Hydrogen and Chlorine
        was no longer being covered up by the government and that all the
        scientists were hopeful for Scragg in its development and marketing.

        He earned his Chemistry Credentials directly under Max Bodenstein.
        He was in charge of explosive testing and evaluation for the Manhattan Project,
        which suppressed this reaction in the academic world only to later travel
        to meet with Scragg in person and tell him that the explosion was no
        longer being suppressed.
