      <h3>More Energetic Than Gasoline</h3>
      <p style="text-indent: 70px;">
        How much energy can one expect to obtain by exploding hydrogen instead
        of gasoline? On an equal weight basis the normal hydrogen explosion produces
        approximately three times as much energy as gasoline. What does the new
        hydrogen process (involving hydrogen, chlorine and radiation) produce?
        Based on numerous recent careful tests made by two independent laboratories
        (one was H.P. White Laboratory, Belair, MD) the new process produces almost
         five times more kinetic (motion) energy than the explosion of hydrogen
         with oxygen. On the basis of an equal weight of fuel, the new hydrogen
         process produces 14 times more kinetic energy than gasoline. This is the
         highest energy output of any known process (other than nuclear reactions
         such as fusion or fission).
       </p>
      <h3>How Tests Were Made</h3>
      <p style="text-indent: 70px;">
        A series of precise side-by-side experiments were carefully carried out
        to determine the kinetic energies resulting when a projectile (wooden ball)
        was given a high impulse thrust out of a mortar using controlled explosions
        of hydrogen. Hydrogen-Oxygen-arc radiation produced a normal explosion
        which propelled the wooden ball with predictable kinetic energy. A side-by-side
        test using hydrogen-chlorine-arc radiation, identical in every way except for
        the substitution of oxygen, gave an impressive result: almost five times greater
        kinetic energy was obtained using hydrogen-chlorine-arc. The energies were
        determined from precise velocity measurements using standard ballistics
        techniques and electrical equipment.
      </p>
      <h3>Significance Of Findings</h3>
      <p style="text-align: left">
        (1) Virtually unlimited energy can be obtained by proper utilization of the process. Since hydrogen and chlorine are readily available from sea water, there is no shortage of fuel and oxidant.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: left">
        (2) Since the product of the explosion is primarily hydrochloric acid, the hydrogen and chlorine needed for the second cycle can be obtained from the product, using known or improved electrolysis technology. In other words, the fuel can be recycled.
      </p>
      <h3>Future Possibilities</h3>
      <p style="text-align: left">
        (1) Since the yield of kinetic energy is extremely high, very efficient lightweight kinetic engines can be used with this process. Thus the process can be applied to internal combustion engines, rotary engines, rockets, and gas turbines.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: left">
        (2) Since plasma (mister of ions and electrons) is produced in the explosion, the process can be used to obtain byproduct electrical current (for example, using a magnetohydrodynamic generator).
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: left">
        (3) Since the kinetic energy is extremely high, electricity can be generated on a small scale (50 kilowatts) as well as on a large scale (1,000 megawatts).
